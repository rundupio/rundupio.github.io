title: Why I use GitHub Pages to host my blog
---
There are a lot of blog host services out there, free or not free. However, [GitHub Page][github] gives me the best among the free services.

- First thing comes first, it's free!
- It's very flexible, you can embed [Google Analytics][gana] into your blog. This is a very important feature if you want to know how is your blog doing on the web, [Google Analytics][gana] gives you rich information about your site. And probably you will need to pay to get this feature into your blog if you use another service provider.
- Ads free, [GitHub Page][github] won't plug-in any Ads into your site, you have full control of your site, you choose what will be shown to our reader. Of cause, you can also host [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense) as a publisher if you want to make some extra $.
- You can have your own customized domain name, again, it's free while other service provider charges a fee to have your own top level domain name. This is very important if you want to build your own brand.

Those are pros, then what are the cons?

- The site on [GitHub Pages][github] are all static, which means you can't have php, database etc. all fancy stuff. But as said below, you can still build your blog without any of those fancy stuff.
- All of your site has to be published at GitHub repository which mean all of your site is public, not an issue at all. All static website are on the Internet are public in certain way.
- You need some technical background if you want to put a blog to [GitHub Pages][github]. [GitHub Pages][github] uses [Jeklly][jek] to generate all of static blog pages, you will need to spend sometimes to play with [Jeklly][jek] to understand how to use it and how it works. That said, it's not very complicated to set everything up. It only took me half day to setup everything on my Linux and publish it as blog. Here is a link I used as reference to build my site: http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/

Conclusion

[GitHub Pages][github] as a free service give me most of the benefits I want to host a blog on Internet. You have our own domain name, [Google Analytics][gana] and other full control.
