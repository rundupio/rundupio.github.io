This is a engineer's way to start something new :)


{% highlight javascript %}
console.log("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}

I'm currently learning a lot of new stuffs trying to build a internet startup with my partner. Everything is new to me, such as *Javascript, RESTFul API, Flask, SaaS...*

Also, I started to run from last year. Begin with finishing 1 miles till now I'm on the way to finish an offical half marathon next weekend in San Francisco. Unfortunately, my ankle was injured during the training, hope it will be ok next weekend!
